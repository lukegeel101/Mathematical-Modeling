# Mathematical-Modeling

UMass Amherst Math456 Spring semester 2022 taught by Professor Lu

Syllabus: This course is an introduction to mathematical modeling. The main goal of the class is to learn how to translate problems from "real-life" into a mathematical model and how to use mathematics to solve the problem. The domain of applicability of mathematics is huge and covers much of the natural sciences, but mathematics plays a central role in modern economics, and increasingly in social sciences. In this class we will pick a number of topics from games and gambling, economics, social sciences, but also magic (card tricks) and some biology (evolutionary theory) to illustrate how mathematics can be useful to analyze concrete problems. From the mathematical point of view we will use elementary tools from probability, game theory, information theory, and optimization. 

Among the problems to be discussed are

The Monty Hall problem: Behind one of three doors is a prize hidden. After you pick one of the three doors, the game show host opens one of the remaining door and reveals no prize. You are given the choice to keep your door or switch. What do you do?

The Gambler's ruin problem. You walk into a casino with $100 and decide to play roulette (say you will bet on red). Your goal is to make at least $1000 or of course get wiped out. What is the optimal strategy in you are faced with unfair bets?

Why are duopolies better than monopolies?

Why are there as many males as females in most animals populations?

Why does it seem that if an accident happens (say a man falls on the rail track) the more people are around the less likely it is that somebody helps?

What are strategies to allocate your money among various investments?

Can mathematics help you to make card tricks?

Many more .......
