## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
n_random = 10
beta = 2
U = runif(n_random, min = 0, max = 1)
Y = (-1/beta)*log(1-U)
Y
```

```{r dice}

dice <-  sample(1:6, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)
plot(dice)
p = 0
if (dice == 1){
  p = p + 1
}
p



```

```{r simulation}
#going to simulate 100 dice rolls
x <-  sample(1:6, 100, replace=TRUE)
count_a <-  0
count_b <-  0
count_ab <-  0
for (val in x){
  if (x == 2 | x == 4 | x == 6 ) {
    count_a = count_a + 1}
  if (x == 1 | x == 2 | x == 3 | x == 4) {
    count_b = count_b + 1}
  if (x == 2 | x == 4 ) {
    count_ab = count_ab + 1}
}
proportion_a = count_a /100
proportion_b = count_b/100
proportion_ab = count_ab/100
print("proportion of a:") 
proportion_a
print("proportion of b:") 
proportion_b
print("proportion of ab:") 
proportion_ab


```
